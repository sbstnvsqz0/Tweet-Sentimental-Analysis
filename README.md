# Tweet-Sentimental-Analysis
This repository contains a Sentimental Analysis Task with a reduced dataset builded with tweets. They were labeled among the following options: positive, negative  or neutral.
The main idea is to compare differents networks like MLP, RNNs (LSTM) and BERT using differents embeddings.
